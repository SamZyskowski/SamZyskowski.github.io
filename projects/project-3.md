summary: I tutored students from the ages of 8-13 in numerous mathematical subjects.

I worked through my high school as an on-call math tutor for any subject at the time.  Throughout my time, I mainly worked with elementay-middle school students who needed help understanding fundamental concepts such decimal division, long division and some algebra.  There was never a point in which this seemed like work in any way; I essentially felt as if I was a babysitter who happened to also tutor in math, which was an excellent motivator to continue tutoring.

Depsite the simplicity of the subject, the age old matra of "Teach to Understand" really held true here, as the more I tutored the more I improved upon my basic mathematical foundation.  This effect was even greater due to my young client base; explaining these subjects to teenagers/young adults would have been much less in-depth than it was teaching the rules and formulas to such a young audience.
