summary: This is a project I created for a CS class I took as a Freshman that implemented a binary search tree to sort and compare contacts based on first name, last name and phone number.

This was one of the culminating assignments to finish off my first semester in CS.  We were assigned to implement a binary search tree using node-based structure to organize passed in contacts in the form of ("First name", "Last name", XXX-XXX-XXXX).  Through the completion of this project, I learned not only the importance of organized and consistent code, but the neccessity of testing.  

Prior to this CS class, I hadn't ever been exposed to the world of testing one's code again and again along the way to ensure the reliability of a program.  It was quite the rude awakening when I learned that we would have to test both our homework assignments as well as each of our lab exercises.  As any disgruntled student would, I found this tedious and unnecessary in the beginning, yet as the semester progressed, so did my appreciation for this strategy of programming.  I know now the importance of testing one's own code, and will undoubtedly use it far into my professional career.
